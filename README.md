# knife-dwim

Knife plugin to save your mind from remembering whether it was "knife
cookbook upload", "knife data bag from file", or "knife role
whatever", and your fingers from typing all of this.

Just use `knife dwim path/to/file`, letting your shell autocomplete
the path for you, and have it uploaded to your Chef server correctly!

## Usage

`knife dwim PATH [PATH [PATH [...]]]`
